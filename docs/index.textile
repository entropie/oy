h1. Oy! README

h1. About

Oy! is a *Wiki* based on *git*. Purely written in *Ruby* with few
dependencies. All you need to use it is clone Oy!, create a new
git repos and start the application.


This is inspired by *gollum*, the *github* wiki. *Ramaze* is the framework.

h2. Architecture

Pathnames for wikipages are as well available in the git repos. So the
page you get while requesting <code>/test/index</code> is equivalent with
<code>/path/to/your/repos/test/index.textile</code>. Media files, for now only
images, are stored in <code>media/</code> with full history.
